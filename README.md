At-A-Glance Reference for Ludeon Studio's Indie Hit, "Rimworld"

### Current Concerns:
The variance and complexity of these XML's isn't making for a very scalable solution to indexing everything...

Additionally, considering that the structure of the XML's themselves change frequently, this static code will need  constant revising. 

Lastly, not only is the structure of the XML changing but the keys are as well. Unless it is at least possible to verify the core keys for each "ThingDef", I don't currently see a way to build this database and also maintain it on future releases. Which makes this a fruitless endevour considering the speed of Ludeon's patch and release frequency.
